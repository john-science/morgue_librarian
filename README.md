> Tools for parsing DCSS morgue files

This project started because I was playing [DCSS](https://crawl.develz.org/wordpress/) and wanted examples of other players who won the game with some character build I was currently trying.  Luckily, like many roguelikes, DCSS creates plain text output files (morgues) at the end of each game with a ton of information about the game (win or lose).

So, with absolutely no promises as to validity or robustness, here are the tools I use to carve up huge numbers of DCSS morgue files and tease out useful information about winning runs.
