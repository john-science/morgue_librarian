# Morgue Librarian

> Tools for parsing DCSS morgue files

This project started because I was playing [DCSS](https://crawl.develz.org/wordpress/) and wanted examples of other players who won the game with various character builds.  Luckily, like many roguelikes, DCSS creates plain text output files (morgues) at the end of each game with a ton of information about the game (win or lose).

So, with absolutely no promises as to validity or robustness, here are the tools I use to carve up huge numbers of DCSS morgue files and tease out useful information.

## Environment

All the code included here was written for Python v3.7, though I suspect any version of Python v3.3 to 3.8 will work.

I have only tested this code to work under Linux, though I suspect it would work under Unix/Mac just fine.
