""" Catalog all the Winning Morgues you have collected

The Idea:

First this script prints out some basics about all the winning morgues it can find:

 * How many winners? What's the oldest? How many of each number of runes?

Then this script will print out some stats on the winning morgues sorted based on user input:

* species
* background
* god
* number of runes
* game version

Ideally, we would make this very flexible so users can design their own queries, within the interests of looking through winning morgue to learn how to play.
